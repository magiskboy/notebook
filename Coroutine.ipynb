    "\n",
    "Follow [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_(computer_programming)\n",
    "> Asynchrony, in computer programming, refers to the occurrence of events independent of the main program flow and ways to deal with such events. These may be \"outside\" events such as the arrival of signals, or actions instigated by a program that take place concurrently with program execution, without the program blocking to wait for results. Asynchronous input/output is an example of the latter cause of asynchrony, and lets programs issue commands to storage or network devices that service these requests while the processor continues executing the program. Doing so provides a degree of parallelism\n",

    "In computer science, we can classify two classes of task:\n",
    "* CPU bound\n",
    "    > In computer science, a computer is CPU-bound (or compute-bound) when the time for it to complete a task is determined principally by the speed of the central processor: processor utilization is high, perhaps at 100% usage for many seconds or minutes. Interrupts generated by peripherals may be processed slowly, or indefinitely delayed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* I/O bound\n",
    "    > I/O bound refers to a condition in which the time it takes to complete a computation is determined principally by the period spent waiting for input/output operations to be completed. This is the opposite of a task being CPU bound. This circumstance arises when the rate at which data is requested is slower than the rate it is consumed or, in other words, more time is spent requesting data than processing it\n",
